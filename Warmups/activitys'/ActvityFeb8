# using the tools we've learned in class 
# up to this point create blocks of code that will return 
# (you can use variables, data types,operators,etc.)

# 1. create a block of code that uses any of the arithmatic 
# operator and then print out the result

# 2. create a block of code that uses uses the AND operstor and a
# print out the result.

# 3. create a block of code that uses the NOT EQUAL operator
# use then print out the result
 # inputalways trnasforms the data into strings.
 # we use int() function to change strings into numbers
 
 # number_A = int(input)('enter a number)
 # number_8 =int(input)('enter another number')

 Fruit A = 'apples'
 Fruit B = 'oranges'
 print(fruit_A != fruit_B)
