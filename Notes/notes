#conditional statement = is a consturct that evaluates
#different code conditions and outputs specific outcomes.

'evaluate specific conditions'
'and will output specific outcomes'

# the IF/ELSE keywords are functions that have 
# been abstracted to make it easier for 
# engineers to use logic

# C = 70 and up
# D = 60 and up 
# F = 59 and up
# Keywords and Clues
# generate a letter grade from a number = Enter a number
# and then send out a letter

# we need to use conditional statements (IF/ElSE/ELIF)
